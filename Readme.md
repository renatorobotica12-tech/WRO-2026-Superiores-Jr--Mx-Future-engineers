---

# 🔄 Ackermann Steering System


The robot uses an Ackermann-inspired steering mechanism powered by an EV3 Medium Motor.


Unlike differential steering systems, Ackermann geometry allows the vehicle to follow more realistic turning trajectories by reducing tire slip.


## Steering Control Method


The steering motor is controlled using encoder positions instead of continuous rotation.


This provides:

</div>


The architecture separates:

- Sensor acquisition.
- Data communication.
- Decision making.
- Vehicle control.


This modular approach allows each subsystem to be tested independently.


---

# 🔌 Custom PCB


One of the most important improvements during development was the creation of a custom Printed Circuit Board.


During early testing, sensors were connected individually using loose wiring.

Although functional, this approach caused:


❌ Cable clutter  
❌ Difficult maintenance  
❌ Loose connections  
❌ Limited organization  


To solve these problems, a dedicated PCB was designed specifically for this robot.


---

## PCB Functions


The custom PCB provides:


| Function | Purpose |
|:---|:---|
| Power distribution | Organized electrical supply |
| Signal routing | Cleaner connections |
| Sensor interfaces | Easy sensor replacement |
| Arduino interface | Simplified communication |
| Cable management | Improved organization |


---

## PCB Advantages


Compared with individual wiring, the PCB provides:


✅ Cleaner internal organization  
✅ Faster assembly  
✅ Easier troubleshooting  
✅ Higher mechanical reliability  
✅ Reduced accidental disconnections  
✅ Better future expansion capability

# 💻 Software Architecture

The Los Grises Jr software was designed following a modular and iterative engineering approach, where each subsystem has a specific responsibility.

Rather than concentrating all functionality into a single control routine, the system separates the main tasks into independent logical components:

Sensor acquisition — Ultrasonic sensors for distance and positioning.
Sensor fusion — Combination of multiple ultrasonic readings to generate a reliable lateral error.
Obstacle detection — Front ultrasonic sensor used as a safety condition.
Motion control — Closed-loop PID controller for steering correction.
Speed control — Dynamic calculation of the VEL variable according to the driving conditions.
Emergency response — Immediate stop and reverse maneuver when an obstacle is detected within the critical distance.
Hardware initialization — Motor D initialization, which acts as the PCB adapter.

This organization improves:

✅ Code readability
✅ Debugging efficiency
✅ Testing capability
✅ Repeatability
✅ System reliability
✅ Ease of maintenance

# 📡 Ultrasonic Sensor Fusion

The robot uses multiple ultrasonic sensors to determine its position relative to the surrounding walls.

Instead of relying on a single sensor, the readings are combined into two groups. Each group represents one side of the robot.

The lateral error is calculated as the difference between both groups:

Side_A = Ultrasonic_1 + Ultrasonic_2

Side_B = Ultrasonic_3 + Ultrasonic_4

ERROR = Side_A - Side_B

This approach provides a more stable representation of the robot's lateral position and reduces the influence of individual sensor variations.

The resulting ERROR becomes the primary feedback signal for the PID controller.

# 🎯 Front Ultrasonic Safety System

A dedicated front ultrasonic sensor is used to detect obstacles ahead of the robot.

The system continuously evaluates the measured distance:

IF front_distance < 25 cm

When the distance falls below the critical threshold, normal PID control is temporarily overridden.

The robot:

Stops the motors.
Waits for a short stabilization period.
Reverses 0.5 motor rotations.
Returns to the main control loop.

This creates a safety override that prevents the robot from continuing forward when an obstacle is detected at close range.

# 🎮 Closed-Loop PID Controller

The main motion-control system is based on a closed-loop PID controller.

The controller receives the calculated ultrasonic error and generates the steering correction required to maintain the desired position.

ERROR
  ↓
PID Controller
  ↓
Steering Correction
  ↓
Motor Command

The PID parameters were experimentally tuned using real track testing.

Rather than relying exclusively on theoretical calculations, the team developed and evaluated multiple iterations of the controller. Each iteration was tested, analyzed, modified, and retested until a stable and efficient configuration was achieved.

The final Kp, Ki, and Kd values therefore represent real-world tuning obtained through track validation.

Control concept
error = sensor_difference

derivative = error - previous_error

integral = integral + error

output =
    (KP × error)
    + (KI × integral)
    + (KD × derivative)

The resulting PID output is used to adjust the motor commands while VEL determines the forward-speed component.

#⚡ Dynamic Speed Control

The variable VEL is used to determine the robot's forward speed during normal operation.

Instead of treating speed as a completely independent constant, the program contains a dedicated section responsible for calculating and updating this variable.

This allows the control system to balance speed and stability, maintaining sufficient forward momentum while preserving the responsiveness of the PID controller.

The speed-control logic was also evaluated through repeated track testing to determine an effective operating range.

# 🔄 Main Control Logic

The complete control strategy can be summarized as follows:

                ┌─────────────────────┐
                │        START        │

# 🧠 Engineering Decisions

Several design decisions were made based on practical testing rather than theoretical assumptions.

Multiple ultrasonic sensors

Using multiple sensors allows the robot to calculate its lateral error from combined measurements instead of depending on a single sensor.

PID instead of open-loop control

The robot continuously reacts to sensor feedback, allowing it to correct deviations dynamically rather than relying on predetermined motor commands.

Front ultrasonic safety override

Obstacle detection has priority over normal motion control. When the critical distance is reached, the PID-driven movement is interrupted and the robot performs a predefined safety maneuver.

# Track-based PID tuning

The PID parameters were not selected exclusively through simulation. They were refined through repeated real-track testing, making the final controller better adapted to the actual mechanical and environmental conditions of the robot.

# Dynamic velocity

Separating VEL from the PID correction allows the system to control forward motion while independently applying steering corrections.

🚀 Future Improvements

Potential improvements to the current software architecture include:

Automatic ultrasonic sensor calibration and offset compensation.
Filtering of ultrasonic readings to reduce measurement noise.
Adaptive PID parameters depending on track conditions.
Automatic optimization of VEL.
Improved obstacle recovery behavior.
Data logging for post-run PID analysis.
Automatic parameter tuning based on recorded track data.
