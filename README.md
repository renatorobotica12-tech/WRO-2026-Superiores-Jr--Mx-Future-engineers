##  Project Overview
---
This project presents the development of an autonomous vehicle designed for the Future Engineers category of the World Robot Olympiad 2026.

The robot is capable of navigating a dynamic environment using a combination of computer vision and closed-loop control systems.

The system integrates:

- Real-time vision processing
- Ackermann steering geometry
- PID-based control

This combination enables stable, precise, and adaptive navigation.


##  Robot Description

The robot is based on an Ackermann steering system, similar to real-world vehicles.

## Why Ackermann Steering?

Compared to differential drive systems, Ackermann steering provides:

- Reduced lateral wheel slip
- Improved curve accuracy
- More realistic motion behavior
- Greater stability at higher speeds

A dedicated motor controls the steering angle, allowing fine adjustments during navigation.

## Control System Architecture

The system is divided into two main subsystems:

1. Vision Processing (Arduino Nano)

- Receives data from the HuskyLens camera
- Detects object color (red/green)
- Extracts horizontal position of the object
- Sends processed data to the EV3

2. Motion Control (EV3)

- Receives processed data
- Controls steering motor and drive motor


| **Data Flow** |
| :---------------: |
|HuskyLens → Arduino Nano → EV3 → Motors|


A custom PCB was developed to:

- Improve connection stability
- Reduce wiring complexity
- Increase reliability during runs
---
## Control Algorithm

The robot follows a vision-based control algorithm:

Process:

- Capture frame from HuskyLens
- Detect object color
- Obtain object horizontal position
- Compute positional error
  The error is calculated based on the difference between the object position and the center of the image.  

- Apply control correction
- Adjust steering angle
- Move forward

Behavior Logic:

- Object centered → move forward
- Object left → steer left
- Object right → steer right

If no object is detected, the robot temporarily maintains the last steering value.
---
## Steering Control (PID)

To achieve stable and precise steering, a PID controller is being implemented.

**Control Objective:**

- Minimize the horizontal deviation between the detected object and the center of the image.

error= xcenter - xobject
 -The error represents the horizontal distance between the detected object and the center of the image.
 
| Parameters | Value |
| :--------: | :---: |
| KP         | 2.0   |
| KI         | 0.0   |
| KD         | 0.5   |

PID Components:

Kp (Proportional): Reacts to current error
Ki (Integral): Reduces accumulated error over time
Kd (Derivative): Dampens oscillations


The controller is currently being tuned to achieve a balance between responsiveness and stability.

## Vision System

The robot uses a HuskyLens AI camera connected to an Arduino Nano.

Capabilities:

Detection of red and green pillars
Real-time object tracking
Position data extraction

Design Considerations:

- Elevated camera placement increases field of view
- Early detection improves reaction time
- Reduces sudden steering corrections
---

---
## Navigation Strategy

The robot uses vision-based navigation to interact with obstacles dynamically.

- Detects colored pillars  
- Determines relative position  
- Adjusts trajectory using steering control  

This approach allows smooth and adaptive movement around obstacles.
---
## Performance 

Initial testing shows:

- Stable trajectory in controlled environments  
- Reduced oscillations compared to initial tests  
- Reliable response to changes in object position  

Further testing and quantitative evaluation are currently in progress.

---

## Challenges

- Integration between EV3 and Arduino systems  
- Achieving stable Ackermann steering control  
- Handling noise in vision detection  
- Tuning PID parameters  
---
## Conclusion

The Los Grises Jr robot integrates:

- Realistic Ackermann steering
- Intelligent vision processing
- PID-based control

This combination enables stable and adaptive navigation, preparing the team for dynamic competition environments.
